To fetch:
------------
To fetch your mysql dump file use the usqlfetcher.py with the following arguments:
<path to web.config> <path to dump.sql> <path to mysqldump.exe> 

Example:
c:/python27/python.exe usqlfetcher.py umbraco/web.config db/dump.sql tools/mysqldump.exe


To push:
------------
To push your mysql dump file use the usqlpusher.py with the following arguments:
<path to web.config> <path to dump.sql> <path to mysql.exe> 

It's almost the same as fetching except you use mysql.exe instead of mysqldump.exe.


Example:
c:/python27/python.exe usqlpusher.py umbraco/web.config db/dump.sql tools/mysql.exe


Future features
---------------
-Next commit will most likely have the Python app compiled to *.exe so you don't need Python installed.
